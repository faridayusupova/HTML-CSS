            <p>`I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!

              Improve his shining tail, <br>
            And pour the waters of the Nile <br>
              On every golden scale! <br>

            `How cheerfully he seems to grin, <br>
              How neatly spread his claws, <br>
            And welcome little fishes in <br>
              With gently smiling jaws!' <br>
